# stock_prediction
A machine learning pipeline to train and predict stock price movement trends (momentum) using stock indicators

I wrote a blog post on this project here: https://rylu1.com/2020/08/29/machine-learning-pipeline-stock-price-trend-predictions/

Demo1 is for creating and storing stock data + indicators in SQL database.

Demo2 is for showcasing predictions in a plot and simulated returns.

Demo3 is a program that provides daily prediction (only need to run once per day).

Both Demo2 and Demo3 rely on Demo1 to be run first.
