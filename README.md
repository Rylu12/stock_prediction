# stock_prediction
A machine learning pipeline to train and predict stock price movement trends (momentum) using stock indicators

I wrote a blog post on this project here: https://rylu1.com/2020/08/29/machine-learning-pipeline-stock-price-trend-predictions/

Demo1 is for creating and storing stock data + indicators in SQL database.

Demo2 is for showcasing predictions in a plot and simulated returns.

Demo3 is a program that provides daily prediction (only need to run once per day).

If Demo1 has not been ran yet for your specific stock name, Demo1 should be ran first before using Demo2 or Demo3.

Demo1 is used to find the right feature variables first for a specific stock and then stored into a SQL database file (which Demo2 and Demo3 uses.)
